##### Overview
This [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) app uses voting data from [The Electoral Commission](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/upcoming-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information) to explore the relationship between the votes cast during the EU Referendum (23 June 2016) and immigration levels by local authority. The app was inspired by a recent article in [theconversation.com/uk](http://theconversation.com/uk) called ['Hard Evidence: how areas with low immigration voted mainly for Brexit'](http://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138)

##### Credits
[Plotly's](https://plot.ly/r/) R graphing library, [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), [formattable](https://github.com/renkun-ken/formattable) and [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) were used in this [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com") app. Code was borrowed and adapted from Kyle Walker's wonderful [shiny app of neighborhood diversity](https://walkerke.shinyapps.io/neighborhood_diversity/).
